# ImageCaptioner

This script was created to help me caption the many images I've downloaded, and store them in a tsv file.

In order to run this, you must run
```
!git clone https://github.com/dzryk/antarctic-captions.git
%cd antarctic-captions/
!git clone https://github.com/openai/CLIP
```

and have antarctic captions in the same directory as this.

This is because I wanted to have an automatic caption suggestion that would help me caption images.
